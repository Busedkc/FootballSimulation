# FootballSimulation 

This project emulates a football league where teams such as Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, 
and Chelsea compete in random matches. The teams' scores are updated according to the match outcomes, and the 
league standings are determined accordingly. The project is implemented using the Go programming language and a MySQL database.
